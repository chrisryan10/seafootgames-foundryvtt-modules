# seafootgames-foundryvtt-modules
Updated module.json for Seafoot Games FoundryVTT map modules

Contains scripted updates to the modules.json for the modules to make
them compatible with V10.

This is for the map modules found in either of these bundles:

* https://www.seafootgames.com/product/the-biggest-battlemap-bundle-ever-940-ttrpg-maps-adventures/
* https://www.seafootgames.com/product/quarantine-battlemap-bundle-520-fantasy-ttrpg-maps/

Copy the module.json file(s) over your extracted version.  When you load the module(s) you
should not get any compatibility warnings
